WordPress powers over 40% of the web, but the plugin ecosystem has a problem: the features people actually need are locked behind paywalls.

We started Open WP Club to fix that. One plugin per problem, fully free, fully open source.

## What we've built so far

We now maintain over 30 plugins covering WooCommerce tools, admin utilities, security helpers, and SEO automation. Every one of them is free — no "pro" tier, no premium upsells.

## What's next

We're expanding beyond plugins into desktop apps, mobile apps, and developer tools. If the WordPress ecosystem needs it and nobody's doing it right, we'll build it.
